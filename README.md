# mqtt
MQTT Broker for HARTING MICA

MQTT stands for MQ Telemetry Transport. It is a publish/subscribe, extremely simple and lightweight messaging protocol, designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks. The design principles are to minimise network bandwidth and device resource requirements whilst also attempting to ensure reliability and some degree of assurance of delivery.

Note that the MQTT Broker Container is based on the open source MQTT broker project Mosquitto v1.4. For more informaton visit the MQTT project page http://mqtt.org/ and the Mosquitto project page http://mosquitto.org/.

This LXC container provides basic MQTT functionality for the HARTING MICA computing appliance. It is intended for experimentation and development, but should not be used for production.
